# Resources

Here's a list of Neo-related resources out there that might be useful to you. And a _big_ thanks to everyone who has taken the time to put these together!

### [Matrix within Matrix. Part 2. Neo.](https://mediasurgery.co.uk/video-episodes/craft/matrix-within-matrix-part-2-neo) :play_or_pause_button:

John Macpherson of [Media Surgery](https://mediasurgery.co.uk) has generously put together this video introduction to Neo, briefly discussing its features and practical use cases over the standard Matrix. We recommend starting with the [part 1 video on Super Table](https://mediasurgery.co.uk/video-episodes/craft/matrix-within-matrix-part-1-super-table) as it covers some of the background to the Neo video.

### [Pushing the Limits of Craft CMS's Matrix Field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXy_-LLjV_U) :play_or_pause_button:
A [Straight Up Craft](http://straightupcraft.com/) hangout hosted by [Ben Parizek](https://twitter.com/benparizek) that features the original developer of Neo, [Ben Fleming](https://twitter.com/benjamminf), along with [Josh Crawford](https://github.com/engram-design) and [Andrew Welch](https://github.com/khalwat). Ben and Josh each showcase their plugins Neo and [Super Table](https://github.com/engram-design/SuperTable), with an in-depth discussion on the limitations of Craft's Matrix field, their experiences developing on Craft and what their goals were with Neo and Super Table.

### [Modelling flexible content sections and recommendations](http://craftcms.stackexchange.com/a/15940/3811) :memo:
[Ian DeRanieri](https://twitter.com/ianderanieri) was kind enough to write up a detailed and screenshot-heavy solution on advanced content modelling techniques using Neo. It's quite a valuable resource for new users of Neo to see how it can be used to model real content.
